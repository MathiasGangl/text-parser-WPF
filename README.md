# text-parser-WPF
Simple text parser written in C# as a WPF application.

I implemented a C# Library (TextParsingLibrary) in a separate project to be compiled into a DLL.
Therefore, to avoid issues with the association between the projects, only open the [Visual Studio Solution File](https://github.com/MathiasGangl/text-parser-WPF/blob/main/TextParserApp/TextParserApp.sln).
Visual Studio will then open both projects in the same Solution Explorer. Otherwise, when opening with the “Open Existing Project” Dialog from Visual Studio I have experienced some issues, that the library could not be found.
